Checking the battery health of an Android device is a great way to make sure that your phone is running efficiently and to keep track of how much battery life is left. Here are some simple tips to help maximize the battery life of an Android device.</p><p>First, you need to access the “Settings” menu on your device. Under the “Battery” section, you can find the “Battery usage” option. This will display a graph of your battery usage for the past few hours or days, as well as a percentage of battery remaining.</p><p>Second, you should always make sure to keep your device up to date. The latest Android version contains various battery life improvements, so it&rsquo;s important to always be running the most recent version. This will also help your device stay secure and bug-free.</p><p>Third, it&rsquo;s important to make sure that you aren&rsquo;t running any unnecessary apps or services in the background. Go to the “Settings” menu, then “Device maintenance” and select “Battery”.
