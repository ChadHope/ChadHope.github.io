This tutorial will guide you through the steps and show you how to make the process quick and painless. Here are the steps:\nFirst, make sure your Apple device is already set up and ready to go. Then connect your Android device to your PC via a USB cable. When your Android device is detected, select the files and folders you’d like to transfer.\nNext, download and install the USB Android Transfer Tool on your PC. This will allow you to quickly and easily transfer your selected Android data to your Apple device. Run the program and select the Transfer option.\nAfter that, select the files and folders you’d like to transfer from the Android device to your Apple device.
