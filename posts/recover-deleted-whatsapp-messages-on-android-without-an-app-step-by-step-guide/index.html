If the deleted messages are not visible, you&rsquo;ll need to create a backup copy of the file. To do this, open the file in a text editor and find the ‘msgstore.db’ file. Using the editor, copy the contents of the file and paste it into a new document.
Finally, save the document as a .txt file and re-upload it to the original folder. This will enable you to view the deleted messages. With this simple step-by-step guide, you&rsquo;ll be able to see deleted WhatsApp messages on Android without an app.</p><h3 id=ii-tips-for-recovering-deleted-messages>II.
