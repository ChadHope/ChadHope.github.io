To do this, you need to open the Settings menu and navigate to the Display settings. Once there, choose the screen size or resolution setting and adjust the size to the desired level. Keep in mind that higher resolutions will result in lower performance, so choose a resolution that’s appropriate for the tablet’s hardware. After you’ve chosen the resolution, head back to the Home screen. You should now be able to enjoy full screen mode on your Android tablet. Keep in mind that some apps may not be optimised for the new resolution, so you may experience some issues. To prevent any compatibility issues, make sure to change the resolution back to the default setting whenever you’re done using full screen mode. This will ensure that all apps will run properly regardless of the screen size. 1.
