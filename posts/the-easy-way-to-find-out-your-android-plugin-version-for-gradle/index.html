You can also check the version of the Gradle Wrapper, which is used to manage the version of Gradle used in the project.\nYou can also find the version of the Android Gradle Plugin directly from the command line. If you are using the command line to build an Android project, you can use the ‘-v’ command option to print out the version of Gradle and the version of the Android Gradle Plugin being used in the build.\nFinally, you can also find the version of the Android Gradle Plugin directly from the build.gradle file. The version of the Android Gradle Plugin used in the project is specified in the build.gradle file. This can be used to ensure that you always have the latest version of the Android Gradle Plugin installed in your project.\n3. Updating Android Gradle Plugin Version Android Gradle Plugin is a piece of software that allows developers to automate parts of the Android development process. It is built on top of the Gradle build tool, a popular build automation tool for Java projects. With the Android Gradle Plugin, developers can easily configure their project, add dependencies, and configure the manifest. Knowing the version of the plugin you are using is essential for successful development.\nThe easiest way to find the version of the Android Gradle Plugin is to look at the build.gradle file. This file is located in the root directory of the project. The version should be located at the top of the file, next to the statement ‘apply plugin’. The version of the plugin should be listed after the colon.\nIt is also possible to find the version number of the plugin by using the command line. If the user is in the root directory of the project, the command ./gradlew -v will return the version of the Android Gradle Plugin. It will be located in the first line between the brackets.\nIf you’re using an older version of the Android Gradle Plugin, it is important to make sure your code is up to date with the latest version. To do this, locate the dependencies section of the build.gradle file. This section should list the versions of the plugin and the libraries it uses. Check to see if any of these libraries need to be updated.\nKnowing the version of the Android Gradle Plugin is an essential part of the successful development of Android applications. It ensures that the application is compatible with all the necessary libraries and components. As a developer, it is important to check and update the version of the plugin regularly.\n2.
