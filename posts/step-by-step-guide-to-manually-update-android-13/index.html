Once the update is completed, your phone will automatically restart and you’ll be running on the latest version of Android. It’s a good idea to back up your data before you start the update process. That way, you’ll have all your data stored just in case something goes wrong.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uzu4Jp7UFpI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q.1 What is a step-by-step guide to manually update Android 13?</p><p>A.1 A step-by-step guide to manually update Android 13 involves downloading the latest version of Android available for your device and then installing it on your device.
