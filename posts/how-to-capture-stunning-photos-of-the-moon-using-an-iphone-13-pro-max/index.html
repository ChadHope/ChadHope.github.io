The key to successful moon photography is to have the correct settings, the right equipment, and a bit of practice. To get started, make sure your iPhone 13 Pro Max is running the latest software update. Then, go to the Camera app and select the “Night” option.

To ensure that the image is sharp and clear, use a tripod or set your iPhone on something steady. To increase the exposure, use the volume buttons to adjust the ISO setting. Finally, use the shutter speed setting to capture the image of the moon. After you’ve taken a picture of the moon, you can edit the image in the Photos app. Apply filters, adjust the contrast and saturation levels, and share your stunning image with friends.

It can be difficult to know how to capture a good shot, especially when shooting something elusive like the moon. Fortunately, Apple&rsquo;s Pro Camera app offers several features and tools to make getting a good shot feel like a breeze. Start by making sure your iPhone 13 Pro Max is updated with the latest iOS and then launch the Pro Camera app. Once the app is open, tap the moon icon in the upper left corner of the screen to choose the Supermoon mode.
